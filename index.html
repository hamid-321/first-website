<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Hamid and I am currently a first year student at The University of Salford studing Computer Science&#46;</p>
<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<p class="newparagraph">In my computer science degree I study 5 modules, these include <strong>Programming 1</strong> and <strong>Web Development and <abbr title="Human Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr>&#46;</strong></p>

<p class="newparagraph">Within Programming 1 we code in Java to create programs consisting of classes which can interact with each other to carry out or simulate tasks&#46;<br>
Java is a type of coding language and is <em>object oriented</em> meaning it creates object from the classes which are coded and uses these objects to carry out the tasks&#46;</p>
<p>An example of some java code can be seen below&colon;</p>
<figure>
	<img src="images/javacode950px.png" alt="An example of some java code" class="responsiveimg">
	<figcaption>This Java constructor was created using an <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> called Visual Studio Code&#46;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="newparagraph">This code shows how a constructor creates a new object once the method is called and which <em>formal parameters</em> are needed to make the constructor funtion&#46; However this is only a small part of the code, once an object has been created there are many other ways it can be interacted with&#46;</p>
<p class="newparagraph">Within Web Development we use <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascasding Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to create functional webpages such as the one you are viewing right now&#46; There are more parts to creating a website such as using <em>JavaScript</em> however this is a more simple model of a website without any scripts&#46;</p>
<p>Some of the <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> used to create the navigation &#40;the red buttons at the top of your screen&#41; of the website can be seen below&colon;</p>
<figure>
	<img src="images/htmlexample950px.png" alt="The HTML code used to create the home button" class="responsiveimg">
	<figcaption>HTML code showing how the Home button was created</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="newparagraph">This shows how the button was created using an <em>unordered list</em> which is denoted by the <em>ul</em> tag&#46; The <em>form action</em> part of the code is what makes the button link to another page&#46; For example, this button links to <strong>index.html</strong> which is this page, so by pressing that home button you would be sent to this page&#46;</p>
<p>The use of <strong>class&equals;</strong> is useful when implementing <abbr title="Cascasding Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> as it allows the styling to target specific elements, the class <em>navbutton</em> was created so the animation where the naviagation buttons expand upon hovering only plays for the 4 buttons which can be seen at the top of the screen. The expanding of the buttons is achieved by the <abbr title="Cascasding Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> shown below&#46;
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="images/cssexample800px.png" alt="The CSS code used to create the expanding button animation" class="responsiveimgSmaller">
	<figcaption>The CSS code used to create one of the animations on the navbuttons&#46;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This code is how the buttons expand and change colour when hovered over by the user, the <em>transition-duration</em> is used to make a small delay in the animation making it look much smoother and an eventual change rather than an instant change&#46;</p>
