  <h2>The University Of Salford &#8211; SEE Building</h2>
  <p class="newparagraph"><a href="https://www.salford.ac.uk/">The University Of Salford</a> was founded on 10/02/1967 and is located in Salford, Manchester&#46; The campus which I study at is called The Peel Park Campus and there are many buildings located there such as the new <abbr title="School Of Science, Engineering &amp; Environment">SEE</abbr> building which was opened earlier this year to be used as a place to study. As I study computer science, alot of my lessons are located in this building and utilise the brand new computer labs and the equipment available within them&#46;</p>

<p class="newparagraph">These are only a couple of the many images of the SEE building, more of these images and much more information about the new building, including the building process can be found on <a href="https://www.salford.ac.uk/science-engineering-and-environment/new-science-engineering-and-environment-building">The University Of Salford Website</a>&#46;</p>
<h2>The University Of Salford &#8211; Chapman Building</h2>
<p class="newparagraph">Although all of my workshops take place in the SEE building, all of my lectures which are in person take place in the Chapman building, to be specific the lectures are in <strong> lecture hall 3 </strong> of the building&#46;</p>
<p>The lecture halls all have 2 screens at the front to ensure all students have a proper view of the slides being presented, there is tiered seating which allows for people at the back to be able to see over the other students while they are seated while a microphone which is connected to speakers through out the hall provides enough sound so you can hear from anywhere in the hall&#46;</p>
